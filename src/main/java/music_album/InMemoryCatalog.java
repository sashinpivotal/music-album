    /**
     * TODO: Do these additional tasks.
     *
     * NOTES:
     * 0. You can tackle them in any order,
     *    each one is independent of the others.
     *    They generally get harder as you go further down.
     *
     * 1. None of these methods should print to stdout (the console).
     *    Instead, return a value.
     *    Each one should be tested by a client method
     *    (add client method yourself) in InMemoryCatalogClient,
     *    and there you *can* print your results,
     *    to verify that your code works correctly.
     *
     * 2. You may need to research a few things, that's
     *    to be expected.  Life Is Open-Book...
     *    The Javadoc is a good first place to look.
     *
     * 3. Keep a lookout for redundant code.  There is a
     *    high probability that you will write a chunk
     *    of code more than once.  When you see that,
     *    you should strongly consider refactoring that
     *    repeated code into a private method, and
     *    then calling that method from where it's needed.
     *    IntelliJ helps a lot here.  Select the repeated
     *    code in question, then
     *    right-click -> Refactor -> Extract Method.
     *    It's not just about removing redundancies - it
     *    will make the more complicated methods easier to write!
